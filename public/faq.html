              <h3 class="question">What is Polandball?</h3>
              <p class="answer">&quot;Polandball&quot;, or sometimes (but less frequently) refereed to as &quot;Countryball&quot; are &quot;meme&quot; comics that are satirically personified as country(ies) with it&#x27;s history, policies as a nation, and foreign relations to other countries.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">Where can I find out more information about these comics?</h3>
              <p class="answer">You can visit the wiki page below to get a general sense as to what and how to make a Polandball Comic, or visit the either the official website or Subreddit for Polandball comics (also below). Comics are posted daily (weekly on the official site) and are great places for inspiration.</p><a href="https://polandball.fandom.com/wiki/Polandball_(meme)" target="_blank" class="link">Wiki </a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/" target="_blank" class="link">Subreddit</a><a href="http://polandball.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Official Site</a></div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">Are there any rules to Polandball?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Yes there are quite a few. Most rules can be found on the wiki page but here are the brief rules on these comics:<br>1. The Countryballs must all be hand drawn using a paint program (i.e. Microsoft Paint). Tools on these programs such as the straight line/circle or fill tools are forbidden to draw these comics, only free form line paint tools may be used to draw these comics. Flags must also be hand drawn (no matter how good or bad that flag is drawn<br>2. Countryballs must be drawn as a circle/sphere with a black border around them. There are a few notable exceptions for certain countries (i.e. Israel Cube, Reichtangle, Nepalrawr etc.) in terms of what shape they must be drawn in.<br>3. Poland&#x27;s flag must be drawn upside down in order to show eye contrast. Asian countries (i.e. China, Vietnam, Japan) usually are drawn with straight lines as eyes.<br>4. Countryballs <strong>CANNOT</strong> have limbs, pupils with their eyes, mouths, eyebrows or hair of any kind. Their emotions are typically displayed with their eye shape.<br>5. Certain Countryballs must contain clothes with their character (i.e. United Kingdom almost always has a hat and monocle, United States is drawn with sunglasses, Indonesia is drawn with a <strong>k</strong>opiah/rice hat in order to distinguish it from Poland, etc.)<br>6. All Countryballs&#x27; dialogue must be written in broken English tailored to their respective location (unless that said country speaks English as a primary language like The US) (note that just because a Countryball speaks in broken English, it does not mean the country&#x27;s people speak the same way. The broken English is meant to be satirical and should not be taken seriously).<br>7. Any other memes, either displayed with dialogue and/or images (i.e. troll faces, &quot;mlg banter&quot;, dank memes, etc.) are not allowed as they do not fit in with the comic&#x27;s style.<br>8. Font styles that are hard to read or are Comics Sans are not allowed.<br><br>All rules can be reviewed by visiting the Polandball&#x27;s Wiki Tutorial below:</p><a href="https://polandball.fandom.com/wiki//r/polandball_Official_Tutorial" target="_blank" class="link">Wiki Tutorial</a></div>

              <h3 class="question">Where can I show off my a PolandBall Comic if I decide to make one?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Your social media is a great place to show off all of your work, not matter what it is. The best place to display however, in my opinion, is the Polandball subreddit (link is below)</p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/" target="_blank" class="link">Subreddit</a></div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">What does this Website do?</h3>
              <p class="answer">I&#x27;m glad you asked! This site allows you to make your own Polandball comics on your own without the hassle and/or difficulty of using paint programs! It allows you to express current news or historic topics that you are interested in through Polandball comic form if you don&#x27;t have the skill or patience to make your own.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">I don&#x27;t understand, these comics are really easy to make. Why even bother making a website?</h3>
              <p class="answer">If don&#x27;t feel that it is necessary to use this website to make Polandball comics, then there is nothing stopping you from doing so. This website is designed for people who feel like they don&#x27;t have the ability to make their own comics, and you are not obligated to use this tool if you don&#x27;t want to. I just really like these comics and wanted to contribute to this community with the skills that I have acquired over the past few months.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">Okay I&#x27;m on board. How do I use this Website to make my comic?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Awesome! You should start by signing up by clicking the link in the upper right corner of the screen. Once that&#x27;s done, click the &quot;Create your own comic&quot; link to begin. Play around with it in order to fully understand how to use this tool</p>

              <h3 class="question">Why aren&#x27;t the Countryballs drawn in a perfect circle?/Why do these comics look the way they do?</h3>
              <p class="answer">These are the rules that the community decided on. Any and all rules for making Polandball comics either by using this website or any paint program are not my personal decisions, but what everyone determined instead. If you would like to make a comic using your own rules then you are more than likely, but it is worth noting that your comic might either get banned from the Polandball Subreddit for violating the rules, or disproved by your viewers either through constructive criticism or typical banter on social medias (i. e. &quot;Your comic is stupid and gay. They should ban you from the internet.&quot; -typical internet user).</p>

            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">How do I correctly word the dialogue in my comic?</h3>
              <p class="answer">The best way to understand the &quot;engrish&quot; that this comic uses it to look up other comics that uses the countryball that you want to use (or is geographically/culturally similar) in order to correctly word your countryball&#x27;s dialouge.</p>

            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">I don&#x27;t have any ideas for my comic. Any advice?</h3>
              <p class="answer">I definitely recommend checking out current world news or read/watch some topics on history. There is a never ending stream of world news and there really isn&#x27;t anything that you can&#x27;t create, as long as it&#x27;s related to a country&#x27;s actions/thoughts/interests.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">These comics are offensive.</h3>
              <p class="answer">The way these comics are made are meant to make fun of the government and not so much it&#x27;s people. Either way these comics are not meant to be taken seriously. If you still find them offensive and want to voice your opinion, then unfortunately your arguments that you would make will probably go unnoticed or will get criticized. It&#x27;s best to ignore, avoid, or just accept anything that you don&#x27;t enjoy, because your opinion is most likely not going to change or remove this sub genre of comics.</p>

            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">How do I represent indigenous/native persons?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Indigenous are represented with billiard balls because most do not have a formal flag or nation. Indigenous Africans are represented with an 8 Ball, 7 Ball for Native Americans and Oceanic Tribes, 1 Ball for East Asians (including Mongolian tribes) and extra terrestrial life/aliens as 6 Balls.</p>

              <h3 class="question">Why do I need to signup for this website?</h3>
              <p class="answer">I decided to use a sign up for this site so that you can save your work on your comics that are either in progress or are finished. I hope to also send out email notifications on any updates for this website (which will be optional if you don&#x27;t want to want to be have your occasional update email fill up your inbox).</p>

              <h3 class="question">A countryball isn&#x27;t on here that I want to use in my comic. What do I do?</h3>
              <p class="answer">If your countryball is not on here it is most likely because I haven&#x27;t drawn and implemented it in to this site. Stay patient and I will get to it as soon as I have time.</p>

              <h3 class="question">I noticed that other Polandball Comics have props/objects in them. How do I put those in my comics?</h3>
              <p class="answer">You can simply do that by using the &quot;Add Outside Object&quot; button. You will need to draw the object that you want, unfortunately (there are just too many to draw). Make sure that you know where you saved your file, and use as little surrounding white space around your object, as that white space might overlap with another countryball/other object.</p><img src="./images/goodExample.png"alt="Good Object Example" class="faqobjectexample"><img src="images/badExample.png" alt="Bad Object example" class="faqobjectexample"></div>

              <h3 class="question">Help there&#x27;s a bug/my comic is messed up! What do I do?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Send me a notification/message on my <a href="https://twitter.com/HarrisonGMoore">Twitter</a> and I will get to it as soon as I have time.<a href="https://twitter.com/HarrisonGMoore"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">I can&#x27;t make a Countryball look a certain way. What do I do?</h3>
              <p class="answer">I will be implementing more custom looks for the countryballs as soon as I have the time. If you would like to get your comic out as soon as possible, you can always use the &quot;Add Outside Object&quot; button to make your own countryball. It will most likely look different from the way I have drawn my countryballs, and the only thing I can say is sorry!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">Can I use this site to post my comic to my social media account?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Of course! Just click on the view your comics button and click on your button for your social media. If your social media isn&#x27;t on there, then you can always just download your comic using the download button and post it manually to your perfected social media. In the future I will add more social media options.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">Is this mobile friendly?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Besides being responsive to basic content like the Home and FAQ pages, no. I figured it would be too hard to make comics on a mobile website due to a small screen. I also don&#x27;t plan to make an app for this site either because I don&#x27;t know how to program form an iPhone or Android. Perhaps one day I will make an app for one mobile platform but I would need to learn Swift (iPhone programming language) or Java (Android programming language).</p>

              <h3 class="question">Who are you?</h3>
              <p class="answer">My name is Harrison and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I have always had a respect for hardware and software that makes your life easier and have wanted to make programs myself. After finding a boot camp that teaches web development, I really have enjoyed the program (even though it was really difficult at times) and would love to make a career out of this.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">Why did you make this website?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Being both a fan of history (with or without memes/PolandBall) and programming, and for my final project of my boot camp. I noticed that Polandball comics were a simple thing to make and came up with this idea for a site. I am really bad at drawing even the most simple things and figured that I would make a site that does it for you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">Why bother making a comic maker when I can just do it myself?</h3>
              <p class="answer">You definitely can make your own Polandball comics without this site, there is nothing from stopping you to do so. I made this website specifically for those who are bad a drawing like me or don&#x27;t like to draw but like these comics, so if you don&#x27;t fit into both of these categories, then this probably isn&#x27;t the site for you</p>

I don&#x27;t post any content because I not really a fan of any social media, but I&#x27;ll respond to any of your Tweets (don&#x27;t mind my profile pic, I thought that it was a funny picture of my dog). I also have a Reddit account, but I mostly lurk/view other people&#x27;s post for the entertainment. High Reddit Karma/Number of Likes on Twitter aren&#x27;t really goals of mine.</p>

            <div class="questionandanswerdiv">
              <h3 class="question">What tools did you use to make this site?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Besides the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript that is used to make most websites, I also used <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a> for the front end for good layout and responsiveness for mobile devices, React for the backend, and SQL Database for to save user account and comic images.</p>

              <h3 class="question">Are you still going to work on this site? What improvements are you going to make to it?</h3>
              <p class="answer">Most definitely! There are plenty of things I want to add to this site. Stay tuned for upcoming features!</p>

              <p class="answer">Tweet to me with my <a href="https://twitter.com/HarrisonGMoore">Twitter</a> Account. I will respond to you whenever I get the chance and would love suggestions or advice. I like to consider myself a nice and chill guy so don&#x27;t be afraid to ask me anything.</p>

              <h3 class="question">Look dude, I know how to use a computer. Your FAQ is treating me like I&#x27;m an idiot.</h3>
              <p class="answer">I worded the answers to the FAQ so that somebody that doesn&#x27;t use a computer that often or hasn&#x27;t used a site like this before (like my Mom) can understand. I have no doubt you in your technological abilities, you are awesome.</p>
